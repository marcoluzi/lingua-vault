## About Lingua Vault
This project is a dynamic language learning application built with the TALL stack (Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Laravel, and Livewire). It empowers users to create lessons from any text in their target language, automatically breaking the content down into individual words for focused learning.

Each word is presented as an interactive element that reflects its learning status through color-coding, and users can easily edit or create associated lexemes by providing translations, optional romanizations, and a status rating. Behind the scenes, the app leverages a proven spaced repetition system based on the SM‑2 algorithm to optimize retention and ensure that each word is reviewed at just the right time.

Whether you’re a beginner or an advanced learner, this tool offers a personalized and engaging way to master vocabulary—one word at a time.
